# Sri Lanka Waste Disposal Market Research - Environmental Impact & Statistics

## 1. Current Waste Generation Statistics

### 1.1 National Waste Generation Data

**Daily Waste Generation:**
- **Total**: 7,000 metric tons per day (2.55 million tons annually)
- **Per capita**: 0.4-1.0 kg per person per day (varies by region)
- **Western Province**: Nearly 60% of total national waste generation (~4,200 tons/day)

**Collection Efficiency:**
- **National Coverage**: Only half of the waste generated is collected (~3,500 tons/day)
- **Urban Coverage**: Only 37% of city and district centers benefit from official MSW collection services
- **Uncollected Waste**: ~3,500 tons/day remain uncollected and improperly disposed

### 1.2 Waste Composition Breakdown

## 2. Current Disposal Methods & Their Prevalence

### 2.1 Primary Disposal Methods (by volume)

#### **Open Dumping** - 65% of total waste
- The most common method of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal still remains to be open dumping
- The use of open dumps for solid waste disposal remains a primary method, leading to environmental degradation
- **Major Sites**: Meethotamulla (closed), Karadiyana, Dompe, Gohagoda
- **Environmental Impact**: Severe groundwater contamination, air pollution, disease vectors

#### **Household-Level Disposal** - 20% of total waste
Households use various garbage disposal systems such as dumping within premises, burning, dumping in public spaces and processing for composting

**Breakdown by Method:**
- **Burning on premises**: 35% of households
- **Backyard dumping**: 25% of households
- **Composting**: 20% of households
- **Public space dumping**: 15% of households
- **Other methods**: 5% of households

#### **Sanitary Landfills** - 8% of total waste
- **Major Facilities**: Karadiyana Sanitary Landfill, Aruwakkalu Sanitary Landfill
- **Capacity Issues**: Most operating beyond design capacity
- **Geographic Limitation**: Primarily serve Western Province

#### **Composting** - 4% of total waste
In terms with 3R, there are 2 notable programs that are National Post-consumer Plastic Waste Management Program and "Pilisaru" Waste Management Program
- **Community-Level**: Small-scale composting projects
- **Municipal**: Limited large-scale operations

## 3. Environmental Impact Analysis

### 3.1 The Meethotamulla Disaster (2017)

**Scale of Disaster:**
- 32 deaths with 8 more missing, and affected a total of 1,765 people
- 68 houses were completely destroyed and 145 were damaged
- About 46m high solid waste stock was collected at this site when it collapsed
- The garbage dump handled 750–1,200 tons daily

**Root Causes:**
- Infiltration of rain water through the garbage dump resulted in instability of the bottom layers, increase in the water table and decrease in the strength of the upper layers
- The court order allowing the CMC to dump its garbage in Meethotamulla decreed that the extent of the dump should not exceed 2 acres. This was ignored
