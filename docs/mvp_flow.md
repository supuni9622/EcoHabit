- Optional: Connect with friends/family for leaderboard.

2. Home Screen (Daily Dashboard)

Components:
- Daily Challenge: e.g., “Recycle 2 plastic bottles today”
- Progress Tracker: visual bar with streaks & points
- Impact Summary: “You saved 0.5 kg of plastic today → equivalent to X liters of water saved”

Feedback Loop: instant reward after action (confetti + “Well done!”)

3. Logging Actions (Self-Reported)

User Journey:
- Select waste type (Plastic, Paper, E-Waste)
- Input quantity (optional photo for fun/social)
