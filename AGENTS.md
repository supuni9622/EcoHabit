- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Comment for only the complext functions.
- Before jump into the answer, if you have any doubt or question, ask it right away

## MCP Tool

- [Sketchfab MCP](https://mcp.so/server/sketchfab-mcp-server)  – 3D asset management

# Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS,
- ThreeJs
- Expo
- Zod
- Zustand
- [Hero UI](https://turborepo.com/) 
- Firebase 
- HTML
- CSS
- [Mono repo turbo repo](https://turborepo.com/) 
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation) 
- [Sketchfab MCP](https://mcp.so/server/sketchfab-mcp-server)  – 3D asset management

## Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.


## Naming Conventions

### File Naming
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `CustomerList.tsx`)
- **Handlers**: kebab-case with domain prefix (e.g., `customer.get.handler.ts`)
- **Services**: PascalCase with Service suffix (e.g., `CustomerService.ts`)
- **Types**: kebab-case (e.g., `customer.types.ts`)
- **Utils**: kebab-case (e.g., `date.utils.ts`)

### Directory Organization
- Group by domain/feature rather than technical layer
- Use plural names for collections (e.g., `handlers/`, `components/`)
- Separate concerns: handlers, services, types, utils


### TypeScript and Zod Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Utilize Zod for schema validation and type inference.

### State Management and Data Fetching

- Use Zustand for state management.
- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.

### Internationalization

- Use i18next and react-i18next for web applications.
- Use expo-localization for React Native apps.
- Ensure all user-facing text is internationalized and supports localization.

### Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
- Utilize guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Use custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize for both web and mobile performance.
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting in Next.js.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images use appropriate formats, include size data, and implement lazy loading.

### Monorepo Management

- Follow best practices using Turbo for monorepo setups.
- Ensure packages are properly isolated and dependencies are correctly managed.
- Use shared configurations and scripts where appropriate.
- Utilize the workspace structure as defined in the root `package.json`.

### Backend and Database

- Use Firebase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Firebase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit and integration tests for critical components.
- Use testing libraries compatible with React and React Native.
- Ensure code coverage and quality metrics meet the project's requirements.

### Key Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages.
- Ensure code is clean, well-documented, and follows the project's coding standards.
- Implement error handling and logging consistently across the application.

### Follow Official Documentation

- Adhere to the official documentation for each technology used.
- For Next.js, focus on data fetching methods and routing conventions.
- Stay updated with the latest best practices and updates, especially for Expo, HeroUI,ThreeJs, and Firebase.

### Documentation
- Create a seperate folder called `project-docs` for the documentations and make sure to strcuture well the documents as per the user stroies and tasks. And keep the documents upto date. 
- Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
- Add examples when appropriate
- Use complete sentences with proper punctuation
- Keep descriptions clear and concise
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Use proper code blocks
- Use proper links
- Use proper headings
- Use proper lists
- Use Swagger for API documentation if required

Output Expectations
